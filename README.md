- [Project 1: Adult Income Analysis with Machine Learning](01_Adult_Income/Adult_Income.ipynb): In this Jupyter Notebook, I conducted an analysis of adult income and applied machine learning to identify income patterns.

- [Project 2: New York Cars Analysis](02_NewYork_Cars/NewYork_Cars.ipynb): In this Jupyter Notebook, you can see an analysis of automobile data from New York, including price-performance ratio and vehicle information.
